# SHORE

Reference site: http://covecollective.org/

## Questions

* Is blue heading a linked heading? Is blue reserved for links?
* Do posts need to support categories?
* Do we need pagination in the blog? Or will all posts ultimately fit on one page?

## TODO

* Sponsor/partner logos
* @2x images

## Scope

To start with, we’d like the main menu to include top-level links as well as separate site pages for:

* Home
* About
* Blog
* Projects, with a dropdown containing two external links: COVE Alpha [http://dev-rc-distro.pantheon.io/] and Infinite Ulysses [InfiniteUlysses.com]
* Credits
* Contact

A linked title and paragraph-length excerpt for the three latest blog posts should appear on the front page. I haven’t written the site copy yet, so let’s use lorem ipsum for now.
